# crb-damage-detector-colab-evaluation
This repo contains an evaluation of output from a [Jupyter notebook running on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aubreymoore/crb-damage-detector-colab/blob/main/detect_and_annotate.ipynb). 

On 2025-08-12 I tested the notebook with 2 small sets of images:
* 5 images of coconut palm images from from Vanuatu provided by Sulav Paudel at AgResearch New Zealand.
* 3 images of coconut palms from Maui provided by Nicole Ferguson at Hawaii Department of Agriculture.

Results from the tests are saved in the **Vanuatu** and **Maui** folders.
